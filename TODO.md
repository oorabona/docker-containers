# Project Backlog

## In Progress

(none)

## Pending

### Medium Priority

- [ ] [CI] Per-container failure tracking via GitHub API (currently using lineage presence as proxy)
- [ ] [Build] PG 18 distributed/full flavors — blocked on Citus PG 18 compatibility

## Completed

(Archived to docs/historic/done-2026-02.md)

## Blocked / Deferred

- [-] ⏭️ [Build] _has_build_args_include() only checks first variant (head -1) — low risk, all current containers have consistent structure

---

## Scope-Specific Backlogs

_As scopes grow, create dedicated TODO_<SCOPE>.md files:_
- `TODO_CONTAINERS.md` - Container-specific tasks
- `TODO_GITHUB_ACTIONS.md` - CI/CD workflow improvements
- `TODO_TESTING.md` - Test infrastructure
