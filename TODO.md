### Medium Priority

_None_

## Completed

- [x] ✅ [Build] REBUILD-001: Per-flavor precise build digest — edge case warnings, test validation, dashboard per-variant display (2026-02-02)

(Archived to docs/historic/done-2026-02.md)

## Blocked / Deferred

- [-] ⏭️ [Build] _has_build_args_include() only checks first variant (head -1) — low risk, all current containers have consistent structure

---

## Scope-Specific Backlogs

_As scopes grow, create dedicated TODO_<SCOPE>.md files:_
- `TODO_CONTAINERS.md` - Container-specific tasks
- `TODO_GITHUB_ACTIONS.md` - CI/CD workflow improvements
- `TODO_TESTING.md` - Test infrastructure
