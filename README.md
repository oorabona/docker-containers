# docker-containers

This is my own Docker repository for `Dockerfile`s and their corresponding `docker-compose` files for easy launch/build.

Idea behind this is to allow easy maintenance of all packages I found useful to containerize.

##Â How to run

You can use the convenience script [here](run.sh) and the main [services file](services.yml) to get prebuilt Docker images and play with dockerized applications.

At the moment only these are considered *applications* :
- mysql-workbench
