# Whitelist approach: exclude everything, then include only what Jekyll needs
exclude:
  - "**"            # Exclude everything first

include:
  - "_config.yml"   # This Jekyll config file
  - "index.md"      # Main redirect page
  - "dashboard.md"  # Main dashboard page
  - "*.md"          # Other root-level markdown files
  - "docs/**"       # All documentation content
  - "_*"            # Jekyll system directories (layouts, includes, etc.)
